**GRADER PLEASE SEE:**

I had accidentally deleted this repo instead of my extra credit project repo. By the grace of the CS gods, I had it open before it was deleted in another browser.
I'd just like to make it clear that no changes were made to the code after the test deadline. However, this old link is *not my final submission* but the only one I could get, so while I'd prefer you grade the latest one as it does not have any errors, I will still provde the link to the old one.

In case code doesnâ€™t work or gives trouble:

I coded this using Eclipse and I know it can cause issues sometimes, so please use this replit link in case downloading is a hassle:

The if/else statement has 23 tokens which I am providing as my test document.
Just press run and it should work but it does take a while. The program only reads the bottom most line to make testing easier, so if you would like to test the other cases, feel free to use the ones provided and put them at the bottom.
