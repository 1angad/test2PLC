In case code doesnâ€™t work or gives trouble:

I coded this using Eclipse and I know it can cause issues sometimes, so please use this replit link in case downloading is a hassle:

The if/else statement has 23 tokens which I am providing as my test document.
Just press run and it should work but it does take a while. The program only reads the bottom most line to make testing easier, so if you would like to test the other cases, feel free to use the ones provided and put them at the bottom.
